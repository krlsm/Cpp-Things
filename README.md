# Cpp-Things
C++ useful things
Random codes I do, and I may use in other projects

# Contributing
Trhough the files there are some //TODO to do.
If something new wants to be added the next constrains must be taken into consideration.

**Coding**

	* All functions are camelCased and self documented with an example of use.
	* All classes/structs are PropertyCased and self documented with an example of use.
	* All functions/classes should be under P23 namespace (PetaCreepers23Utils -> P23U too long -> P23)

**File Naming**

	* If the file contains non templated code, it should be .hpp extension.
	* If the file contains only templated code, it should be .h extension.
	* No .cpp files allowed, I restrict this for easy include and compile.
	* If the file contains utility about a thing, it should be name utilityThing.*
	* If the file contains only one class for a task it should be named classTask.*

For testing right now there are no requirements, just make sure it works and compiles.
