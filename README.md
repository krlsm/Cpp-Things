# Cpp-Things
C++ useful things
Random codes I do, and I may use in other projects

Though the files there are some //TODO to do.
If something new wants to be added the next constrains must be taken into consideration.
	* All functions are camelCased and self documented with an example of use.
	* All classes/structs are PropertyCased and self documented with an example of use.
	* If the file contains non templated code, it should be .hpp extension.
	* If the file contains only templated code, it should be .h extension.
	* No .cpp files allowed, I restrict this for easy include and compile.
	* All functions/classes should be under P23 namespace (PetaCreepers23Utils -> P23U too long -> P23)
